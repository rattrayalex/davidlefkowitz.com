Written in April, 2010 for Guillaume Sutre and Kyunghee Sutre-Kim, *On Hearing Her Play the Harp* is a response to the 8th-Century Tang Dynasty poet Li Duan’s poem *The Harp Sings*:

聽箏	tíng zhēng

鳴箏金粟柱，	míng zhēng jīn sù zhù 
素手玉房前。	sù shǒu yù fáng qián
欲得周郎顧，	yù dé zhōu láng gù
時時誤拂絃。	shí shí wù fú xián

The harp—of fragrant sweet osmanthus—sings,
Her bare hands floating in the air above.
Longing to catch young Zhou Yu’s attention,
From time to time she touches the wrong strings.

La harpe d’osmanthus parfumé chante,
Ses mains nues flottent dans l’air au-dessus.
Voulant attirer l'attention de Zhou Yu,
De temps en temps, elle touche les mauvaises cordes.

*(Translations from the Chinese by David S. Lefkowitz)*

The first “wrong note” is the G-natural at the end of measure 8, drawing the attention of the violin.

The music should be performed freely and expressively.  It is approximately 6’20” in duration.
